File Management

In Unix, there are three basic types of files :

1. Ordinary Files − An ordinary file is a file on the system that contains data,
   text, or program instructions. In this tutorial, you look at working with
   ordinary files.

2. Directories − Directories store both special and ordinary files. For users
   familiar with Windows or Mac OS, Unix directories are equivalent to folders.

3. Special Files − Some special files provide access to hardware such as hard
   drives, CD-ROM drives, modems, and Ethernet adapters. Other special files are
   similar to aliases or shortcuts and enable you to access a single file using
   different names.
   
A. Listing Files
   ls 
     -l ==> Symbolic link file. Links on any regular file.
     -b ==> Block Special File. Block input/output device file such as a physical
            hard drive. 
     -c ==> Character special file. Raw input/output device file such as a physical
            hard drive.
     -d ==> Directory file that contains a listing of other files and directories.
     -p ==> Named pipe. A mechanism for interprocess communications.
     -s ==> Socket used for interprocess communication.
B. Metacharacters
   ls ch*.txt ==> Menampilkan Semua file format txt dengan awalan ch
   ls *.txt   ==> Menampilkan Semua File dengan format txt
   
C. Hidden Files
   File yang directory diawali dengan titik (.)
   Beberapa Contoh Directory/Files hidden.
    .profile − The Bourne shell ( sh) initialization script
    .kshrc − The Korn shell ( ksh) initialization script
    .cshrc − The C shell ( csh) initialization script
    .rhosts − The remote shell configuration file

D. Creating Files
   vi namafile.txt
   
   l key to move to the right side.

   h key to move to the left side.

   k key to move upside in the file.

   j key to move downside in the file.
   
   
E. Display Content File
   cat test.txt     ==> Display File
   cat -b test.txt  ==> Display File with line number
   
F. Counting Words in a File
   wc test.txt
   wc test.txt test2.txt test3.txt
   
   Here is the detail of all the four columns −
   - First Column − Represents the total number of lines in the file.
   - Second Column − Represents the total number of words in the file.
   - Third Column − Represents the total number of bytes in the file. This is the
     actual size of the file.
   - Fourth Column − Represents the file name.
   
 G. Copying Files
    cp source_file destination_file
    cp test.txt test2.txt
   
 H. Renaming Files
    mv old_file new_file
    mv Namafile Filebaru
    
 I. Deleting Files
    rm test
    rm test test2 test3  
    
 J. Standar Unix Streams
    Under normal circumstances, every Unix program has three streams (files)
    opened for it when it starts up    
    1. stdin − This is referred to as the standard input and the associated file
       descriptor is 0. This is also represented as STDIN. The Unix program will
       read the default input from STDIN.
    2. stdout − This is referred to as the standard output and the associated file
       descriptor is 1. This is also represented as STDOUT. The Unix program will
       write the default output at STDOUT
    3. stderr − This is referred to as the standard error and the associated file
       descriptor is 2. This is also represented as STDERR. The Unix program will
       write all the error messages at STDERR.
