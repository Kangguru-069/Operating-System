     $ ls -l /usr/bin/passwd

     $
     
   Shows that the SUID bit is set and that the command is owned by the root. A
   capital letter S in the execute position instead of a lowercase s indicates
   that the execute bit is not set.
   
   If the sticky bit is enabled on the directory, files can only be removed if you
   are one of the following users −
   - The owner of the sticky directory
   - The owner of the file being removed
   - The super user, root
   To set the SUID and SGID bits for any directory try the following command −
     $ chmod ug+s dirname
     $ ls -l
       drwsr-sr-x 2 root root  4096 Jun 19 06:45 dirname
     $
     
     
     
When applying permissions to directories on Linux, the permission bits have different meanings than on regular files.
   1. The read bit (r) allows the affected user to list the files within the directory
   2. The write bit (w) allows the affected user to create, rename, or delete files
   within the directory, and modify the directory's attributes
   3. The execute bit (x) allows the affected user to enter the directory, and access
   files and directories inside
   4. The sticky bit (T, or t if the execute bit is set for others) states that files
   and directories within that directory may only be deleted or renamed by their
   owner (or root)
