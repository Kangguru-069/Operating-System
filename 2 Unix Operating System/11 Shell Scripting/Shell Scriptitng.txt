Shell Scripting

A shell is a command-line interpreter and typical operations performed by shell scripts include file manipulation, program execution, and printing text.

A. Extended Shell Scripts
   Shell scripts have several required constructs that tell the shell environment
   what to do and when to do it. Of course, most scripts are more complex than the
   above one.
   
   The shell is, after all, a real programming language, complete with variables,
   control structures, and so forth. No matter how complicated a script gets, it is
   still just a list of commands executed sequentially.
   
   The following script uses the read command which takes the input from the
   keyboard and assigns it as the value of the variable PERSON and finally prints
   it on STDOUT.
   Example :
   #!/bin/sh
   
   # Author : Rahul Khan
   # Ini adalah Comment
   # Script :
   
   echo "Ketikkan Sebuah nama: "
   read A
   echo "Hello, $A"
   
B. Shell Prompt
   You can customize your command prompt using the environment variable PS1
   explained in the Environment tutorial.
   
C. Shell Types
   - Bourne Shell(sh)
   - C Shell(csh)
   - Korn Shell(ksh)
   - Bourne Again Shell(bash)
   - POSIX Shell(sh)
   - TENEX/TOPS C Shell(tcsh)
   
D. Shell Script
   Note all the scripts would have the .sh extension. 
   Before add anything else to script,we need to add shebang. shebang construct
   function is to alert the system that shell script is being started.
   Example :
   #!/bin/bash
   pwd
