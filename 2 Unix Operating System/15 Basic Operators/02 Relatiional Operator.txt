2. Relational Operators
   Bourne Shell supports the following relational operators that are specific to
   numeric values. These operators do not work for string values unless their value
   is numeric.
   
   Operator	Description	Example
   -eq	            =   	[ $a -eq $b ] 
   -ne	           !=		[ $a -ne $b ]
   -gt	           >		[ $a -gt $b ]
   -lt		   <		[ $a -lt $b ]
   -ge	  	   >=		[ $a -ge $b ]
   -le	           <=		[ $a -le $b ]
    
    Contoh :
    #!/bin/sh

    a=20
    b=50

    if [ $a -eq $b ]
    then
        echo "$a -eq $b : Yes, a is equal to b"
    else
        echo "$a -eq $b: No, a is not equal to b"
    fi

    if [ $a -ne $b ]
    then
        echo "$a -ne $b: No, a is not equal to b"
    else
        echo "$a -ne $b : Yes, a is equal to b"
    fi

    if [ $a -gt $b ]
    then
        echo "$a -gt $b: a is greater than b"
    else
        echo "$a -gt $b: a is not greater than b"
    fi

    if [ $a -lt $b ]
    then
        echo "$a -lt $b: a is less than b"
    else
        echo "$a -lt $b: a is not less than b"
    fi

    if [ $a -ge $b ]
    then
        echo "$a -ge $b: a is greater or  equal to b"
    else
        echo "$a -ge $b: a is not greater or equal to b"
    fi

    if [ $a -le $b ]
    then
        echo "$a -le $b: a is less or  equal to b"
    else
        echo "$a -le $b: a is not less or equal to b"
    fi
    
    Output :
    20 -eq 50 : a is not equal to b
    20 -ne 50 : Yes, a is not equal to b
    20 -gt 50 : a is not greater than b
    20 -lt 50 : a is less than b
    20 -ge 50 : a is not greater or equal to b
    20 -le 50 : a is less or equal to b    
    
    The following points need to be considered while working with relational
    operators :
    1. There must be spaces between the operators and the expressions. For example
       2+2 is not correct; it should be written as 2 + 2.
    2. if...then...else...fi statement is a decision-making statement which has
       been explained in the next chapter.
