C SHELL Operator

1. Arithmetic and Logical Operators
   1. ( ) Change precedence (Hak Akses)
   2. ~   1's complement
   3. !   Logical negation
   4  *   Multiply
   5. /   Divide
   6. %   Modulo
   7. +   Add
   8. -   Subtract
   9. <<  Left shift
   10. >> Right shift
   11. == String comparison for equality
   12. != String comparison for non equality
   13. =~ Pattern matching
   14. &  Bitwise "and"
   15. ^  Bitwise "exclusive or"
   16. |  Bitwise "inclusive or"
   17. && Logical "and"
   18. || Logical "or"
   19. ++ Increment
   20. -- Decrement
   21. =  Assignment
   22. *= Multiply left side by right side and update left side
   23. /= Divide left side by right side and update left side
   24. += Add left side to right side and update left side
   25. -= Subtract left side from right side and update left side
   26. ^= "Exclusive or" left side to right side and update left side
   27. %= Divide left by right side and update left side with remainder
   
   
2. File Test Operator (File Inquiry Operators)
   1. -r file
      Checks if file is readable; if yes, then the condition becomes true.
   2. -w file
      Checks if file is writable; if yes, then the condition becomes true.
   3. -x file
      Checks if file is executable; if yes, then the condition becomes true.
   4. -f file
      Checks if file is an ordinary file as opposed to a directory or special file; if yes, then the condition becomes true.
   5. -z file
      Checks if file has size greater than 0; if yes, then the condition becomes true.
   6. -d file
      Checks if file is a directory; if yes, then the condition becomes true.
   7. -e file
      Checks if file exists; is true even if file is a directory but exists.
   8. -o file 
      Checks if user owns the file; returns true if the user is the owner of the file.
