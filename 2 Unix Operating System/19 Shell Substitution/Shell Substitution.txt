Shell Substitution

Contoh :
#!/bin/sh

a=10
echo -e "Value of a is $a \n"

Output :
Value of a is 10

Without -e the result
Output :
Value of a is 10\n

Escape Sequences can be used in echo command
1. \\ backslash
2. \a alert(BEL)
3. \b backspace
4. \c suppress trailing newline
5. \f form feed
6. \n new line
7. \r carriage return
8. \t horizontal tab
9. \v vartical tab
10. -E option to disable the interpretation to backslash escapes (default)
11. -n option to disable the insertion of a new lne




Command Substitution

Syntax :
`command`

when performing the command substitution make sure that you use the backquote, not the single quote character.

Contoh :
#!/bin/sh

DATE=`date`
echo "DATE is $DATE"

USERS=`who | wc -l`
echo "Logged in users are $USERS"

UP=`date ; uptime`
echo "Uptime is $UP"



Variable Substitution
Variable substitution enables the shell programer to manipulate the value of a variable.

table variable substitution :
1. ${var}          ==> Substitute the value of var.

2. ${var:-word}    ==> If var is null or unset, word is substituted for var. The
                       value of var does not change.

3. ${var:=word}    ==> If var is null or unset, var is set to the value of word.

4. ${var:?message} ==> If var is null or unset, message is printed to standard
                       error. This checks that variables are set correctly.

5. ${var:+word}    ==> If var is set, word is substituted for var. The value of
                       var does not change

Contoh :
#!/bin/sh

echo ${var:-"Variable is not set"}
echo "1 - Value of var is ${var}"

echo ${var:="Variable is not set"}
echo "2 - Value of var is ${var}"

unset var
echo ${var:+"This is default value"}
echo "3 - Value of var is $var"

var="Prefix"
echo ${var:+"This is default value"}
echo "4 - Value of var is $var"

echo ${var:?"Print this message"}
echo "5 - Value of var is ${var}"

Output :
#1
Variable is not set
Value of var is ---

#2
Variable is not set
Value of var is Variable is not set

#3
---------------
Value of var is

#4
This is default value
Value of var is Prefix

#5
substitution.sh: 3: var: Hello Hello
