SYSTEM PERFORMANCE

A Free tools that are available to monitor and manage performance on Unix systems. These tools also provide guidelines on how to diagnose and fix performance problems in the Unix environment.

Major resource types that need to be monitored and tuned :
- CPU
- Memory
- Disk Space
- Communications Lines
- I/O Time
- Network Time
- Applications Programs

1. Performance Components
   1. User State CPU
      The actual amount of time the CPU spends running the usersâ€™ program in the
      user state. It includes the time spent executing library calls, but does not
      include the time spent in the kernel on its behalf
   2. System State CPU
      This is the amount of time the CPU spends in the system state on behalf of
      this program. All I/O routines require kernel services. The programmer can
      affect this value by blocking I/O transfers
   3. I/O Time and Network Time
      This is the amount of time spent moving data and servicing I/O requests
   4. Virtual Memory Performance
      This includes context switching and swapping
   5. Application Program
      Time spent running other programs - when the system is not servicing this
      application because another application currently has the CPU
      
2. Performance Tools
   Unix provides following important tools to measure and fine tune Unix system
   performance
   1. nice/renice
      Runs a program with modified scheduling priority
   2. netstat
      Prints network connections, routing tables, interface statistics, masquerade
      connections, and multicast memberships
   3. time
      Helps time a simple command or give resource usage
   4. uptime
      This is System Load Average
   5. ps
      Reports a snapshot of the current processes
   6. vmstat
      Reports virtual memory statistics
   7. gprof
      Displays call graph profile data
   8. prof
      Facilitates Process Profiling
   9. top
      Displays system tasks
